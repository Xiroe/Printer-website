    <p>The HP LaserJet P3015 is a fast, monochrome laser printer that is small
      in size, but can support high-volume printing for small- to mid-sized offices
      or workgroups. The printer only measures just 17.6 inches wide, 16.2 inches
      deep, and 12.4 inches high, and weighs a mere 35.1 pounds, but packs a
      powerful punch in its small package. The printer’s super fast 540 MHz
      processor helps the printer to quickly decode complex text and images
      at a rate of 42 pages per minute. In addition to exceptionally fast
      print speeds, the HP LaserJet 3015 produces documents with good quality,
       due to its 1200 dpi x 1200 dpi resolution. However, you will probably
       want to use documents produced on the HP LaserJet P3015 for internal
       use only, rather than for marketing materials or documents to impress
         clients, because image quality has been shown to be somewhat subpar.
